                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Treis Adiutor! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our academic commissioning services, which include but are not limited to written works, editing & arts, and programming tasks (collectively, the “Services”). By engaging with Treis Adiutor, whether through our website, social media channels, or direct communication, you (“Client”) agree to be bound by these Terms. These terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Treis Adiutor. Please read them carefully before using our Services. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Services. Your continued access or use of our services constitutes your acceptance of these terms.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">2. Services Offered</h2>
                <p>Treis Adiutor provides a diverse range of commissioned services to meet your academic needs. These services are classified into three main categories: Written Works, Editing & Arts, and Programming. Please note that while we strive to provide high-quality results, the specific nature and content of our outputs are determined by the project specifications and details provided by the client. We encourage all clients to review our full services list for a detailed understanding of all services provided. For the full list of services, visit our services page.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">3. Payment Policy and Receipt Requirement</h2>
                <p>Initial Payment: A minimum non-refundable down payment of fifty percent (50%) of the total agreed service cost is required to initiate any project. No work will commence until this payment is received.</p>
                <p>Payment Method: All payments must be made exclusively to the financial accounts specified by Treis Adiutor. We are not responsible for resolving any issues that arise from payments made to incorrect accounts. The client must verify the accuracy of the provided payment information.</p>
                <p>Receipt Requirement: A valid proof of payment (receipt, screenshot of the transaction, bank transfer confirmation, etc.) is mandatory for the transaction to be considered valid. Transactions without a proper proof of payment will be treated as void, and we will not be obligated to initiate or complete the service. It is the client's responsibility to provide and retain this proof.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>Once a project has commenced, cancellations are generally not permitted. If a Client requests to cancel a commission, a cancellation fee equivalent to thirty percent (30%) of the total service cost will be charged. This fee compensates for work done and resources allocated.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">5. Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>No refunds will be issued, except under special circumstances deemed necessary by Treis Adiutor at our sole discretion. Any refund request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The decision to grant a refund is final and at the sole discretion of Treis Adiutor.</p>
